        " **1. Meaning**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Multithreading** means dividing a single process (or program) into **multiple threads** that can run **concurrently**.\n",
        "  Each thread shares the same memory and resources of that process.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Multiprocessing** means running **multiple processes** at the same time.\n",
        "  Each process has its **own memory space** and works **independently**.\n",
        "\n",
        " **2. Example**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Multithreading:**\n",
        "  Think of a web browser — one thread loads the page, another downloads images, and another plays music.\n",
        "  All these threads belong to the **same application** and share memory.\n",

        "* **Multiprocessing:**\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        " **1. Automatic Garbage Collection**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python automatically removes unused objects from memory through **Garbage Collection (GC)**.\n",
        "* However, sometimes GC may **not run at the right time**, causing **unnecessary memory usage**.\n",
        "* This can make long-running programs **slow or memory-heavy**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Reference Counting Issues**\n",
